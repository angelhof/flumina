*** TODO Create a makefile rule that pulls and makes the Flumina base in a subdirectory
*** TODO Find a way to remove the dialyzer warning for unknown Flumina functions.

That could be solvable by installing Flumina as an Erlang application (e.g. mnesia, etc)


*** TODO Clean up the experiment running scripts and remove everything that is not needed anymore

*** TODO Make the abexample use a tags and not a1 a2 now that we have correct spec/impl

This would actually make some experiments go wrong 
(because we wouldn't be able to setup different a's arriving on the same node)
In a sense, addind key to the tags allows us to create artificial implementation tags to
experiment.


*** TODO Implement an example with a key value store and write read incr for each key
